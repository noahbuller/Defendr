### Steps to Create Feature

***BEFORE MAKING CHANGES (GIT STATUS SHOULD BE CLEAR)***
1. Ensure staging is up-to-date
2. Create new branch with format 'feature/name_of_feature' with: `git checkout -b feature/name_of_feature`
3. BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE ON THE NEW BRANCH: `git push -u origin <name_of_branch>` --> this ensures the branch is being tracked so you can push to the branch and track your work
4. When dev is done --> make PR to staging branch
